Kotail is just starting development. Kotail's intent is to be a super easy to use jmx enabled monitoring tool that can correlate date of multiple jvm instances and even different mbeans into one graph for monitoring load tests and even production systems. It's not aiming to be a monitoring solution, but, just a better way to visualize the happenings of a running system.

The simple use is to watch multiple jvms get load as you play with load balancer settings. Or, to watch statistics shift between different cache settings on different systems of the same application.
